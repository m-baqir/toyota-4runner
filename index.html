      <p>The Toyota 4Runner has a long and impressive history that precedes it. It first came into production in 1984
        and has been in production since then. Over the years it is a name-plate that has become synonymous with
        adjectives like rugged, tough, reliable and indestructible. There is no doubt that many renowned experts in the
        automotive industry would not shy away from calling the 4Runner perhaps the most reliable vehicle ever built.
        For these reasons, the 4Runner has developed a cult-like following that spans many generations. These are the
        type of vehicles that are passed down from father to son and still get the job done.</p>
      <p>A 4Runner that is in decent condition for sale on the used-car market hardly ever has trouble selling. In most
        cases, the vehicle is bought without being on the market very long. I personally have had experience with this
        when earlier this year I had my eye on one 4Runner. I needed a week or so to get my cash together to make a down
        payment on the vehicle but within that one week, the vehicle was gone.</p>
      <p>People who love this vehicle have been customizing it for many years now. There are tons of aftermarket parts
        available on the market that allow someone to customize their 4Runner to their liking. There are parts that make
        the vehicle more rugged, stylish, modern and off-road worthy. Chances are if you wanted to customize something
        on your 4Runner, someone has probably done it already. Everything from lights to custom body work to custom
        seats, can all be found in the aftermarket community of this truck.</p>
